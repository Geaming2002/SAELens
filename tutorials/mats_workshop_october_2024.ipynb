    "\n",
    "1. `architecture`: Specifies the type of SAE architecture being used, in this case, the standard architecture (encoder and decoder with hidden activations, as opposed to a gated SAE).\n",
    "2. `d_in`: Defines the input dimension of the SAE, which is 768 in this configuration.\n",
    "3. `d_sae`: Sets the dimension of the SAE's hidden layer, which is 24576 here. This represents the number of possible feature activations.\n",
    "4. `activation_fn_str`: Specifies the activation function used in the SAE, which is ReLU in this case. TopK is another option that we will not cover here.\n",
    "5. `apply_b_dec_to_input`: Determines whether to apply the decoder bias to the input, set to True here.\n",
    "6. `finetuning_scaling_factor`: Indicates whether to use a scaling factor to weight initialization and the forward pass. This is not usually used and was introduced to support a [solution for shrinkage](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/3JuSjTZyMzaSeTxKk/addressing-feature-suppression-in-saes).\n",
    "7. `context_size`: Defines the size of the context window, which is 128 tokens in this case. In turns out SAEs trained on small activations from small prompts [often don't perform well on longer prompts](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/baJyjpktzmcmRfosq/stitching-saes-of-different-sizes).\n",
    "8. `model_name`: Specifies the name of the model being used, which is 'gpt2-small' here. [This is a valid model name in TransformerLens](https://transformerlensorg.github.io/TransformerLens/generated/model_properties_table.html).\n",
    "9. `hook_name`: Indicates the specific hook in the model where the SAE is applied.\n",
    "10. `hook_layer`: Specifies the layer number where the hook is applied, which is layer 7 in this case.\n",
    "11. `hook_head_index`: Defines which attention head to hook into; not relevant here since we are looking at a residual stream SAE.\n",
    "12. `prepend_bos`: Determines whether to prepend the beginning-of-sequence token, set to True.\n",
    "13. `dataset_path`: Specifies the path to the dataset used for training or evaluation. (Can be local or a huggingface dataset.)\n",
    "14. `dataset_trust_remote_code`: Indicates whether to trust remote code (from HuggingFace) when loading the dataset, set to True.\n",
    "15. `normalize_activations`: Specifies how to normalize activations, set to 'none' in this config.\n",
    "16. `dtype`: Defines the data type for tensor operations, set to 32-bit floating point.\n",
    "17. `device`: Specifies the computational device to use.\n",
    "18. `sae_lens_training_version`: Indicates the version of SAE Lens used for training, set to None here.\n",
    "19. `activation_fn_kwargs`: Allows for additional keyword arguments for the activation function. This would be used if e.g. the `activation_fn_str` was set to `topk`, so that `k` could be specified.\n",

This includes many of the parameters that went into the SAE config (in fact, this class contains a method `get_base_sae_cfg_dict()` which returns a dictionary that can be used to create the associated `SAEConfig` object). However, it also includes many other arguments which are specific to the training process itself. You can see the full set of config parameters in the source code for `LanguageModelSAERunnerConfig`, however for our purposes we can group them into ~7 main categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data generation** - everything to do with how the data we use to train the SAE is generated & batched. Recall that your SAEs are trained on the activations of a base TransformerLens model, so this includes things like the model name (which should point to a model [supported by TransformerLens](https://neelnanda-io.github.io/TransformerLens/generated/model_properties_table.html)), hook point in the model, dataset path (which should reference a HuggingFace dataset), etc. We've also included `d_in` in this category since it's uniquely determined by the hook point you're training on.\n",
    "2. **SAE architecture** - everything to do with the SAE architecture, which isn't implied by the data generation parameters. This includes things like `d_sae` (which you are allowed to use, although in practice we often specify `expansion_factor` and then `d_sae` is defined as `d_in * expansion_factor`), which activation function to use, how our weights are initialized, whether we subtract the decoder bias `b_dec` from the input, etc.\n",
    "3. **Activations store** - everything to do with how the activations are stored and processed during training. Recall we used the `ActivationsStore` class earlier when we were generating the feature dashboards for our model. During training we also use an instance of this class to store and process batches of activations to feed into our SAE. We need to specify things like how many batches we want to store, how many prompts we want to process at once, etc.\n",
    "4. **Training hyperparameters (standard)** - these are the standard kinds of parameters you'd expect to see in an other ML training loop: learning rate & learning rate scheduling, betas for Adam optimizer, etc.\n",
    "5. **Training hyperparameters (SAE-specific)** - these are all the parameters which are specific to your SAE training. This means various coefficients like the $L_1$ penalty (as well as warmups for these coefficients), as well as things like the resampling protocol - more on this later. Certain other architectures (e.g. gated) might also come with additional parameters that need specifying.\n",
    "6. **Logging / evals** - these control how frequently we log data to Weights & Biases, as well as how often we perform evaluations on our SAE (more on evals in the second half of this exercise set!). Remember that when we talk about evals during training, we're often talking about different kinds of evals than we perform post-training to compare different SAEs to each other (although there's certainly a lot of overlap).\n",
    "7. **Misc** - this is a catchall for anything else you might want to specify, e.g. how often you save your model checkpoints, random seeds, device & dtype, etc."

To enable WandB, set `log_to_wandb=True`. The `wandb_project` parameter in the config controls the project name in WandB. You can also control the logging frequency with `wandb_log_frequency` and `eval_every_n_wandb_logs`. A number of helpful metrics are logged to WandB, including the sparsity of the SAE, the mean squared error (MSE) of the SAE, dead features, and explained variance. These metrics can be used to monitor the training progress and adjust the training parameters. We'll discuss these metrics more in later sections.\n",

    "#### Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reconstruction vs sparsity metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "As we've discussed, most metrics you log to WandB are attempts to measure either reconstruction loss or sparsity, in various different ways. The goal is to monitor how these two different objectives are being balanced, and hopefully find pareto-improvements for them! For reconstruction loss, you want to pay particular attention to **MSE loss**, **CE loss recovered** and **explained variance**. For sparsity, you want to look at the L0 and L1 statistics, as well as the activations histogram (more on that below, since it's more nuanced than \"brr line go up/down\"!).\n",
    "\n",
    "The L1 coefficient is the primary lever you have for managing the tradeoff between accurate reconstruction and sparsity. Too high and you get lots of dead features (although this is mediated by L1 warmup if using a scheduler - see below), too low and your features will be dense and polysemantic rather than sparse and interpretable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another really important point when considering the tradeoff between these two metrics - it might be tempting to use a very high L1 coefficient to get nice sparse interpretable features, but if this comes at a cost of high reconstruction loss, then there's a real risk that **you're not actually learning the model's true behaviour.** SAEs are only valuable when they give us a true insight into what the model's representations actually are, and doing interpretability without this risks being just a waste of time. See discussion [here](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/tEPHGZAb63dfq2v8n/how-useful-is-mechanistic-interpretability) between Neel Nanda, Ryan Greenblat & Buck Schlegris for more on this point (note that I don't agree with all the points made in this post, but it raises some highly valuable ideas that SAE researchers would do well to keep in mind).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ...but metrics can sometimes be misleading\n",
    "\n",
    "Although metrics in one of these two groups will often tell a similar story (e.g. explained variance will usually be high when MSE loss is small), they can occasionally detach, and it's important to understand why this might happen. Some examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "- L0 and L1 both tell you about sparsity, but feature shrinkage makes them detach (it causes smaller L1, not L0)\n",
    "- MSE loss and KL div / downstream CE both tell you about reconstruction, but they detach because one is myopic and the other is not\n",
    "\n",
    "As well as being useful to understand these specific examples, it's valuable to put yourself in a skeptical mindset, and understand why these kinds of problems can arise. New metrics are being developed all the time, and some of them might be improvements over current ones while others might carry entirely new and unforseen pitfalls!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dead features, resampling & ghost gradients\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dead features** are ones that never fire on any input. These can be a big problem during training, because they don't receive any gradients and so represent permanently lost capacity in your SAE. Two ways of dealing with dead features, which Anthropic have described in various papers and update posts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ghost gradients** - this describes the method of adding an additional term to the loss, which essentially gives dead latents a gradient signal that pushes them in the direction of explaining more of the autoencoder's residual. Full technical details [here](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2024/jan-update/index.html#dict-learning-resampling).\n",
    "2. **Resampling** - at various timesteps we take all our dead features and randomly re-initialize them to values which help explain more of the residual (specifically, we will randomly select inputs which the SAE fails to reconstruct, and then set dead featurs to be the SAE hidden states corresponding to those inputs).\n",
    "\n",
    "These techniques are both useful, however they've been reassessed in the time after they were initially introduced, and are now not seen to be as critical as they once were (especially [ghost grads](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2024/march-update/index.html#dl-update)). Instead, we use more standard techniques to avoid dead features, specifically a combination of an appropriately small learning rate and an L1 warmup. We generally recommend people use resampling and not ghost gradients, but to take enough care with your LR and L1 warmup to avoid having to rely on resampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming we're not using ghost gradients, resampling is controlled by the following 3 parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `feature_sampling_window`, which is how often we resample neurons\n",
    "- `dead_feature_window`, which is the size of the window over which we count dead features each time we resample. This should be smaller than `feature_sampling_window`\n",
    "- `dead_feature_threshold`, which is the threshold below which we consider a feature to be dead & resample it\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dense latents & learning rates\n",
    "\n",
    "Dense latents are the opposite problem to dead latents: if your learning rate is too small or L1 penalty too small, you'll fail to train latents to the point of being sparse. A dense latent is one that fires too frequently (e.g. on >1/100 or even >1/10 tokens). These features seem generally uninterpretable, but can help with youre reconstruction loss immensely - essentially it's a way for the SAEs to smuggle not-particularly-sparse possibly-nonlinear computation into your SAE.\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be difficult to balance dense and dead latents during training. Generally you want to drop your learning rate as far down as it will go, without causing your features to be dense and your training to be super slow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note - what (if any) the right number of dense or dead latents should be in any situation is very much an open question, and depends on your beliefs about the underlying feature distribution in question. One way we can investigate this question is to try and train SAEs in a simpler domain, where the underlying features are easier to guess about (e.g. OthelloGPT, or TinyStories - both of which we'll discuss later in this chapter).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interpreting the feature density histogram\n",
    "\n",
    "This section is quoted directly from Joseph Bloom's [excellent post](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/f9EgfLSurAiqRJySD/open-source-sparse-autoencoders-for-all-residual-stream#Why_can_training_Sparse_AutoEncoders_be_difficult__) on training SAEs:\n",

    "> Feature density histograms are a good measure of SAE quality. We plot the log10 feature sparsity (how often it fires) for all features. In order to make this easier to operationalize, I’ve drawn a diagram that captures my sense of the issues these histograms help you diagnose. Feature density histograms can be broken down into:\n",
    "> - **Too Dense**:  dense features will occur at a frequency > 1 / 100. Some dense-ish features are likely fine (such as a feature representing that a token begins with a space) but too many is likely an issue.\n",
    "> - **Too Sparse**: Dead features won’t be sampled so will turn up at log10(epsilon), for epsilon added to avoid logging 0 numbers. Too many of these mean you’re over penalizing with L1.\n",
    "> - **Just-Right**: Without too many dead or dense features, we see a distribution that has most mass between -5 or -4 and -3 log10 feature sparsity. The exact range can vary depending on the model / SAE size but the dense or dead features tend to stick out.\n",

    "[Here](https://wandb.ai/callum-mcdougall/arena-demos-tinystories-v3/workspace?nw=nwusercallummcdougall) is a link to a WandB project page with seven training runs. The first one (Run #0) is a \"good\" training run (at least compared to the others), and can be thought of as a baseline. Each of the other 6 runs (labelled Run #1 - Run #6) has some particular issue with it. Your task will be to identify the issue (i.e. from one or more of the metrics plots), and find the root cause of the issue from looking at the configs (you can compare the configs to each other in the \"runs\" tab). Note that we recommend trying to identify the issue from the plots first, rather than immediately jumping to the config and looking for a diff between it and the good run. You'll get most value out of the exercises by using the following pattern when assessing each run:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Looking at the metrics, and finding some which seem like indications of poor SAE quality\n",
    "2. Based on these metrics, try and guess what might be going wrong in the config\n",
    "3. Look at the config, and test whether your guess was correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, a reminder - you can look at a run's density histogram plot, although you can only see this when you're looking at the page for a single run (as opposed to the project page).\n",

    "This run had too small an L1 coefficient, meaning it wasn't learning a sparse solution. The tipoff here should have been the feature sparsity statistics, e.g. L0 being extremely high. Exactly what L0 is ideal varies between different models and hook points (and also depends on things like the SAE width - see the section on feature splitting earlier for more on this), but as an idea, the canonical GemmaScope SAEs were chosen to be those with L0 closest to 100. Much larger than this (e.g. 200+) is almost definitely bad, especially if we're talking about what should fundamentally be a pretty simple dataset (TinyStories, with a 1L model).\n",

The fact that resampling was seemingly unable to reduce the number of dead latents is a sign that our `d_sae` was larger than it needed to be.\n",

In this case, we can see that most loss curves are still dropping when the training finishes, suggesting that this model was undertrained.\n",
